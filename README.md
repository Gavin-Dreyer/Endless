# Endless

## Welcome!

### There are a few ways to see the page
  1. The easiest way is to check out the netlify [deployment!](https://goofy-babbage-315fb2.netlify.app/)
  2. You can also view it by running a local server <br />
      -- First, clone the repo <br />
      -- Second, run npm install <br />
      -- Third, run npm run serve <br />
      -- Finally, go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) or a similar port if that one is already taken(it will be automatically decided)
  3. If you have VS Code with Live Server or another text editor with a similar extension, you can view a production version that is minified <br />
      -- First, clone the repo <br />
      -- Second, run npm install <br />
      -- Third, run npm run build <br />
      -- Finally, Once the app is done building and you see /dist directory, open a new VS Code window with /dist as the root and launch Live Server!

### Tests!
  To run tests simply run from the root of the repo
  ```
  npm run test:unit
  ```
